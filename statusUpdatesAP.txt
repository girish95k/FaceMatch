Warning : Everyone plzzz try staying away from the theatres showing CHENNAI EXPRESS , its surely not worth the money u pay Its one of the worst movie done by SRK , DP and Rohit shetty Its totally brainless and is filled with stupid PJ's So better AVOID IT .............

She was a student. She was 23. She was coming back from a date with her boyfriend. Her fault: she boarded the wrong bus. And oh yeah, SHE WAS A GIRL!!! Six men raped her one by one. And left her to die on the road. Naked. Wounded. Exposed. Devastated. What’s more no one even turned to look at her. No one even bothered to throw a shawl on the ill-clad, ill-fated girl. She can never lead a normal married life again. She has gone into coma five times since 16th December. She is unconscious, critical and hasn’t been able to stop crying. But don’t worry, she wasn’t your sister. She wasn’t your daughter. But she could be. The brutality has to stop right here guys. These people deserve a capital punishment for their heinous, pervert act. I VOTE FOR A CAPITAL PUNISHMENT!!! Please show her that you care. Please show her that you all are there for here. Maybe that’s all she will ever have to live by. I didn’t know her. But she is related to me by the universal bond of humanity. From a girl who doesn’t want to face the same fate MY HUMBLE REQUEST PEOPLE PLEASE COPY AND PASTE IT AS YOUR STATUS AND TELL ANYONE AND EVERYONE YOU KNOW. USE PHONE, BBM, WHATSAPP, FACEBOOK, TEXT MESSAGES. INFORM AS MANY PEOPLE YOU KNOW. DO THIS FOR HER. DO THIS FOR YOURSELF. SHE NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT, NOT SYMPATHY. 
Hi friends ........... Here is a bad news for all those who fell in love with my Little pup BRUNO [CHOCO] the moment they saw him Its sad to tell u that this Beauty no more exists ...... he left us Today and became a beautiful star in the sky ..... Before he came into my life , I was just a normal guy .......I was more worried about my looks , Gave attention to my needs first rather than to others , was busy pampering myself by spending every penny that i had on my Clothes .....BUT ......He was Gifted to me by my Friends and Dec 3rd and my life completely changed I started thinking about his needs first rather than thinking about mine I started pampering him with out paying attention to my self I started saving money so that i can use it for his future needs I wrote assignment from my right hand while my left had was busy cuddling him i enjoyed every bit of my sleepless nights that i spent in taking care of him But now He is no more Am really sorry BRUNO if there was any mistake from my side in taking care of ur health And Am really sorry friends for not able to rise up to ur expectations in taking care of him Hope His Soul rests in Peace Will always miss u BRUNO
